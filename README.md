# Ridesharing Analysis
Practicum by Yandex Project 5

# Project Description
You're working as an analyst for Zuber, a new ride-sharing company that's launching in Chicago. Your task is to find patterns in the available information. You want to understand passenger preferences and the impact of external factors on rides.

You'll study a database, analyze data from competitors, and test a hypothesis about the impact of weather on ride frequency.

# Data description
`neighborhoods` table: data on city neighborhoods
* `name`: name of the neighborhood
* `neighborhood_id`: neighborhood code

`cabs` table: data on taxis
* `cab_id`: vehicle code
* `vehicle_id`: the vehicle's technical ID
* `company_name`: the company that owns the vehicle

`trips` table: data on rides
* `trip_id`: ride code
* `cab_id`: code of the vehicle operating the ride
* `start_ts`: date and time of the beginning of the ride (time rounded to the hour)
* `end_ts`: date and time of the end of the ride (time rounded to the hour)
* `duration_seconds`: ride duration in seconds
* `distance_miles`: ride distance in miles
* `pickup_location_id`: pickup neighborhood code
* `dropoff_location_id`: dropoff neighborhood code

`weather_records` table: data on weather
* `record_id`: weather record code
* `ts`: record date and time (time rounded to the hour)
* `temperature`: temperature when the record was taken
* `description`: brief description of weather conditions, e.g. "light rain" or "scattered clouds"

`/datasets/project_sql_result_01.csv`. It contains the following data:
* `company_name`: taxi company name
* `trips_amount`: the number of rides for each taxi company on November 15-16, 2017.

`/datasets/project_sql_result_04.csv`. It contains the following data:
* `dropoff_location_name`: Chicago neighborhoods where rides ended
* `average_trips`: the average number of rides that ended in each neighborhood in November 2017.

`/datasets/project_sql_result_07.csv` â€” the result of the last query. It contains data on rides from the Loop to O'Hare International Airport. Remember, these are the table's field values:
* `start_ts`: pickup date and time
* `weather_conditions`: weather conditions at the moment the ride started
* `duration_seconds`: ride duration in seconds
